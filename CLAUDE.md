# LeetCode Practice Workspace

This is a LeetCode practice environment.

## Rules

1. **Do not edit solution files** unless explicitly asked for help
2. **Tests can be written freely** - this is the primary use case
3. Only provide hints or modify solutions when the user specifically requests assistance
4. Write the tests in the main function of the file that's open.

## Test Style

- Minimal code, no fluff
- No verbose descriptions or styling
- Just straightforward assertions
- Just write the tests that are included in leetcode problem description if known, don't make up any extra unless asked
- Write tests passed if all tests pass

## Typical Workflow

- User writes their own solution
- User asks Claude to write tests for the solution
- Claude writes tests without altering the solution code
